# 🧪 Practice: Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains **practice notebooks** where I explored **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering** techniques on the **Mall Customers dataset** to understand how customer segmentation works.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains the following features:

- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

## 🎯 Objective

To practice unsupervised machine learning by grouping customers based on:
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Customer_Segmentation_using_K_Means_Clustering.ipynb` – Practice using **K-Means Clustering**
- `Customer_Segmentation_using_Hierarchical_Clustering.ipynb` – Practice using **Hierarchical Clustering**

## 🔍 Practice Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Select relevant features for clustering  
3. Use the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters (for K-Means)  
4. Apply clustering algorithms  
5. Visualize customer segments using scatter plots and dendrograms

## 📊 Output Visuals

- **WCSS Elbow Plot** (K-Means)
- **Dendrogram** (Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Clustered Scatter Plots** with centroids and labels

---

## 💡 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

## ✅ Summary

Successfully practiced and visualized clustering techniques using the **Mall_Customers** dataset to segment customers into meaningful groups based on purchasing behavior.
